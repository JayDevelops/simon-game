# Simon Says Game On Web Browser
Summary: Uses JavaScript for game logic which can go to any level you can memorize up to!
At the start press any button on your keyboard to initiate the game, memorize
the pattern and keep going until you forget a pattern! Fun sounds and colors will light up as you progress, once
you hear the game over sound you may restart the game  at any time you'd like.

## What It shows

styling is consistent and well versed in JavaScript.
